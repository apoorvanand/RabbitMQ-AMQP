# RabbitMQ-AMQP

The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware.

This repository contains NeoLoad Advanced Actions that allows performance testers using NeoLoad to send messages to RabbitMQ using the AMQP protocol.

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/RabbitMQ-AMQP/releases/latest)
1. Read the NeoLoad documentation to see [How to install a custom Advanced Action](https://www.neotys.com/documents/doc/neoload/latest/en/html/#25928.htm)

## Usage

MQSend action requires:
1. A 'MQConnect' action is executed before the action to establish the connection to RabbitMQ.
2. A 'MQDisconnect' action is executed after the action to close the connection.

A good practice is to put 'MQConnect' in the 'Init' container of the Virtual User Path and the 'MQDisconnect' in the 'End' container. It ensures that the connection is estably once per Virtual User.

## Action 'MQConnect'

Connects to Rabbit MQ.

| Name                     | Description       |
| ---------------          | ----------------- |
| connectionName           | the name of the connection  
| Hostname                 | name/IP address of RabbitMQ server 
| Port                     | Port used to connect , send & receive message .Default value= 5672 |
| Virtualhost              | Namespace for objects like exchanges, queues & bindings |
| Username                 | Username for connecting to the queue |
| Password                 | Password for connecting to the queue |

Status Codes:
* NL-MQConnect_Error: Any error while connecting to RabbitMQ. 

## Action 'MQSend'

Sends a messages to Rabbit MQ.

| Name                     | Description       |
| ---------------          | ----------------- |
| connectionName           | the name of the connection as specified in the 'MQConnect' action |
| Exchangechannelname      | name of exchange channel used for binding the queue|
| Excahngechanneltype      | Type of exchange channel: possible values are direct/topic/headers/fanout |
| Qeuename                 | (optional) Name of Queue |
| Routingkey               | (optional) key for routing message to queue |
| Message                  |  Message to send to the queue |

Status Codes:
